# dawa-autocomplete-ts

DAWA Autocomplete TS is a rewrite of [SDFIdk/dawa-autocomplete2](https://github.com/SDFIdk/dawa-autocomplete2) using TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

## About

The aim of this project is to create an implementation of the [Dawa Autocomplete API](https://dawadocs.dataforsyningen.dk/dok/api/autocomplete) written in Typescript. This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the bundler, and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing.

## Code standards

This project is using an opinionated configuration of eslint and prettier to ensure a high standard of code quality.

Instead of `NPM` this project uses `PNPM`
